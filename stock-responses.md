    I'm trying not to be rude but the volume of recruiter spam I'm getting is becoming really irritating. For future reference:
    a) Don't email me an opportunity off the back of a key word search. Check out my CV or LinkedIn profile before forwarding opportunities. It really shows a complete lack of effort on your part.
    b) I've dealt with a lot of recruiters in my time. A Â£500 referral fee is pathetic considering the potential fee your company receives on each placement.
     
    Going forward, I'll be telling my network of technical people about every recruiter/recruitment company which clearly isn't concerned about the level of service they provide and shows a distinct lack of effort when it comes to matching potential candidates to a role. As you know, the London tech scene is very similar to the game 'six degrees of kevin bacon' - word gets around.

    I'll also be requesting you be added to http://shitrecruiters.github.io
     
    I hope this provides some insight and helps with future placements.
     
    Kind Regards
